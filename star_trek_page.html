        <h1> How it Began </h1>
        <h3> Star Trek: The Oringal Series <i>(1977)</i></h3>
        <p>
            The creation of this show spawned from Paramount Executive pushing creator Gene Roddenberry to make a show. What he came up with was
            What resulted was a Pilot called "The Cage". This pilot had a completly different cast from what we ended up with. With the exception of
            Lenord Nimoy, who plays Spock in the show. Executives called the show slow, not enough action, to celeberal, and they didnt like that there 
            was a women in a leadership role. The last part is the most messed up part the critism, yet this was a common issue in the industry.
            The show was remade and with a whole new cast. One where there was a William Shatner who was more explosive compared to Jeffery Hunters captian
            Kirk who was more calm and reserved, which made the Spook in the cage from Dramatic. Complete oppsite of what we see as Spook Today. The shows
            creates these relatble and routable characters. This can not be appaent when looking at Shatner's Kirk and Nimoy's Spook
        </p>

        <h3> Star Trek: The Next Generation <i>(1980)</i> </h3>
        <p>
            A whole new crew took over the bridge of the enterprise. With the captian of the enterpise played by Sir Patrick Stewart.
            The pilot outdid any other Star Trek episode by numbers and any other shows at the time. The show as a result of Paramount wanting to make a Star Trek movie,
            yet over the success of Star Wars, they didnt think that two space sci-fi movies would in the market would be good. Therfore they moved
            their attention to a new show with new models, sets and props with the original cast returning. Then once again they changed their mind and made several movies 
            with the original cast. 20 Years in 1986 the show finally premeried and held massive ratings for years.
        </p>

        <h3> Star Trek 2009 <i>(1983)</i></h3>
        <p>
            This film is what introduced me to the series by my uncle. This is JJ Abrams reboot/sequel to the original series. Staring Chris Pine as Kirk, 
            Zachary Quinto as Spook, Zoe Saldana as Nyota, Karl Urban as McCoy, Simon Pegg as Scotty and even Lenord Nimoy as Spook from another dimension.
            The show looks at a differnt version of these characters, one where everyone is younger and more problematic. This movie spawned two more movies, 
            JJ Abrams went on to even direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
