        <h1> How it Began </h1>
        <h3> A New Hope <i>(1977)</i></h3>
        <p>
        It all started with a New Hope, orginally called Star Wars. This was a movie no one wanted to take a chance except for. 
        George Lucus even realized how much he hated directing through the process of making this movie. He had to finesse his own
        visual effects company, now the famous ILM. He thought he movie was going to be a bust, so much so he gave away a percentage of the 
        box office revenue to Steven Speilberg for a percentage of his movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The Film was a smashing hit
        and spawned one of the top selling franchises to this very day. Adjusting for infaltion the film made 775 millon dollars, with a budget of just 1 million
        </p>

        <h3> Empire Strikes Back <i>(1980)</i> </h3>
        <p>
            Regarded to most as the best Star Wars Media ever produced with many iconic moments. With the Battle of Hoth, a war filled ice planet. We meet 
            master Yoda who trains Luke into becoming a better Jedi. While Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C3PO make their way to Cloud City where they meet
            Lando Calrissian an old friend of Han's. To the eventual betrayl that lead to one of the most iconic moments in cinema. "I Am Your Father"
        </p>

        <h3> Return of the Jedi <i>(1983)</i></h3>
        <p>
            This film is seen as the weakest of the bunch. We got to see Emperor Palpatine, Ewoks and Green Lightsabers all in this one film for the 
            first time. Fun fact about the Green Lightsaber, the only reason why they changed the color was because the Blue blended in with the sky
            in the scene, thefore they changed the color of the saber. After this film it would take a little more than a decade for the next set of films. 
            Otherwise, known as the Prequels
